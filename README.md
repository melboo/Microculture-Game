## Microculture Game

MicroCulture is a card-based event game that embodies the behavior of our human microbiome. It is also an icebreaker game that relies on a simple form of social interaction. The idea is to create correlations between the needs of the culture and the actual personal preferences and cultural backgrounds of the players. The goal is to be a part of the largest culture of human microbes at the end of the event. The more bacteria there is in a culture, the more diverse that culture is.
